I just made frontend part of rbac. there is no backend database for it. i tried to implement roles and permission by hard coding the roles in mockuser.js.
to view changes you can go to mockuser.js and change the roles accordingly
there are total 3 roles for now- admin, editor, viewer
admin can see all things
editor can see editor and dahsboard section
viewer can only see viewer section and dashboard
